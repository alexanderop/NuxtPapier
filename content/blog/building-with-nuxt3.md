# Building Modern Web Apps with Nuxt 3

Nuxt 3 is a powerful meta-framework built on top of Vue 3, offering an incredible developer experience and outstanding performance out of the box.

## Why Choose Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 brings several game-changing features that make it an excellent choice for modern web development:

### 1. Performance First

With its hybrid rendering capabilities, Nuxt 3 allows you to choose between:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for better SEO and faster initial page loads
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for ultimate performance
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** for dynamic applications

### 2. Developer Experience

The developer experience in Nuxt 3 is exceptional:

```vue
<script setup>
// Auto-imported composables
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/data')

// Auto-imported components
// Just use <MyComponent /> without imports!
</script>
```

### 3. Built-in Features

Nuxt 3 comes with batteries included:
- **Auto-imports**: Components, composables, and utilities are automatically imported
- **File-based routing**: Create routes by adding files to the `pages/` directory
- **Data fetching**: Powerful data fetching utilities with `useFetch` and `useAsyncData`
- **State management**: Built-in state management with `useState`

## Getting Started

Starting a new Nuxt 3 project is as simple as:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Best Practices

When building with Nuxt 3, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Use TypeScript**: Nuxt 3 has excellent TypeScript support out of the box
2. **Leverage auto-imports**: Don't manually import what Nuxt can auto-import for you
3. **Optimize images**: Use the `@nuxt/image` module for automatic image optimization
4. **Follow conventions**: Stick to Nuxt's conventions for a smoother development experience

## Conclusion

Nuxt 3 represents a significant leap forward in Vue.js development. Its combination of performance, developer experience, and built-in features makes it an excellent choice for projects of all sizes.
