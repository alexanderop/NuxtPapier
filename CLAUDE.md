# CLAUDE.md

Never delete claude.md files.
This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server on http://localhost:3000 (IMPORTANT: Never run this command automatically - the user will ensure the dev server is running)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build locally
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint with auto-fix for code quality

### Production Deployment

- `pnpm generate` - Generate static site for static hosting
- `pnpm build` - Build for server deployment with SSR

## Architecture Overview

This is a Nuxt 3 application using Vue 3 with the following key architectural decisions:

### Core Stack

- **Framework**: Nuxt 3.17.5 with Vue 3.5.17
- **CSS Framework**: UnoCSS with Wind4 preset (utility-first CSS)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (required - do not use npm or yarn)
- **TypeScript**: Fully configured with strict type checking

### Module Architecture

The application leverages Nuxt's module system with these pre-configured modules:

- `@nuxt/content` - For markdown/content management
- `@nuxt/image` - Automatic image optimization
- `@nuxt/fonts` - Font loading optimization
- `@nuxt/icon` - Icon component with 100k+ icons
- `@unocss/nuxt` - Atomic CSS framework

### Project Structure

```
/
├── app.vue          # Root application component
├── pages/           # File-based routing (create as needed)
├── components/      # Vue components (create as needed)
├── composables/     # Vue composables (create as needed)
├── server/          # Server-side API routes and middleware
├── public/          # Static assets served at root
└── content/         # Markdown content (when using @nuxt/content)
```

### Configuration Files

- `nuxt.config.ts` - Main Nuxt configuration
- `uno.config.ts` - UnoCSS configuration with Wind4 preset
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint rules (auto-generated by Nuxt)

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Features

1. **Pages**: Create `.vue` files in `pages/` directory for automatic routing
2. **Components**: Use `components/` directory for auto-imported components
3. **Composables**: Place reusable logic in `composables/` for auto-import
4. **API Routes**: Create server API routes in `server/api/` directory

### Code Style

- ESLint is configured for Vue 3 and Nuxt best practices
- Run `pnpm lint` before committing
- TypeScript is required for all new code

### Component Development

- See `components/CLAUDE.md` for detailed component development guidelines
- Includes naming conventions, structure, props declaration, and styling rules

### Important Notes

- This is an ESM-only project (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- No testing framework is currently configured
- Git main branch is `main` (not master)
- Project uses MIT License (Copyright 2025 Alexander Opalic)

## Site Configuration

The site configuration is centralized in two main files:

### app.config.ts

Contains the main site configuration accessible via `useAppConfig()`:

- **site**: Core site settings including title, description, author info, and behavior options
- **pages**: Metadata for different pages (title, description, ogImage)
- **socials**: Social media links imported from constants.ts

Key configuration options:

- `website`: Your deployed URL (leave empty in dev, required for production SEO)
- `lightAndDarkMode`: Enable/disable theme switching
- `postPerIndex/postPerPage`: Control post pagination
- `showArchives/showBackButton`: Toggle UI features
- `dynamicOgImage`: Auto-generate OG images when not specified

### constants.ts

Contains:

- **SOCIALS**: Array of social media links with icons (using Iconify names)
- **SHARE_LINKS**: Social sharing configurations with URL builders

Usage example:

```vue
<script setup>
const appConfig = useAppConfig()
const siteTitle = appConfig.site.title
const socials = appConfig.socials
</script>
```

## Best Practices

- After completing a task, always run lint and typecheck and fix any issues

## Available MCP Tools

Claude Code has access to the following MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for enhanced functionality:

### Playwright MCP (PRIMARY BROWSER AUTOMATION TOOL)

- Advanced browser automation with Playwright
- Navigate to URLs, take screenshots, click elements, fill forms
- Execute JavaScript in browser context
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use Playwright MCP instead of Puppeteer for browser automation tasks

### Nuxt MCP (PRIMARY FOR NUXT/VUE DOCUMENTATION)

- Specialized tools for Nuxt and Vue development
- Access to official Nuxt documentation and resources
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use Nuxt MCP for questions about Nuxt, Vue, or related ecosystem tools instead of Context7
- Configured in `.mcp.json` with:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "nuxt": {
        "url": "https://mcp.nuxt.com/sse"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Context7 MCP

- Access to documentation for other libraries and frameworks (non-Nuxt/Vue)
- Resolve library names to Context7-compatible IDs
- Fetch comprehensive library documentation with code examples
- **NOTE**: Use this only for non-Nuxt/Vue related documentation needs
